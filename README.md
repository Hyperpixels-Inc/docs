    <h1>The V Programming Language Documentation</h1>
</div>

This documentation is based on the original V documentation that can be found in
[vlang/v](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md).
It has been heavily rewritten for most of the articles, although some articles have remained almost unchanged.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide more detailed information about V than the original 
documentation, and also to provide a better reading experience, as the documentation is hosted on a 
separate site.

Also, dividing the documentation into separate articles makes it easier to delve into each article, 
as well as easier to add new articles or entire sections.
