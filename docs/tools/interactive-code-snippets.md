# Interactive Code Snippets

As you may have noticed, this documentation contains blocks of code that you can run while reading.

For example:

```v play
fn main() {
	println('Hello, Interactive Playground!')
}
```

This is done with
[V Playground Component](https://github.com/vlang-association/playground-component).
This component is easily embedded on any web page.
See
[Project README](https://github.com/vlang-association/playground-component/blob/master/README.md)
for more details.
