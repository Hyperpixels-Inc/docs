# Limited operator overloading

Operator overloading defines the behavior of certain binary operators for certain types.

```v
struct Vec {
	x int
	y int
}

fn (a Vec) str() string {
	return '{${a.x}, ${a.y}}'
}

fn (a Vec) + (b Vec) Vec {
	return Vec{a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y}
}

fn (a Vec) - (b Vec) Vec {
	return Vec{a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y}
}

fn main() {
	a := Vec{2, 3}
	b := Vec{4, 5}
	mut c := Vec{1, 2}

	println(a + b) // "{6, 8}"
	println(a - b) // "{-2, -2}"
	c += a
	//^^ autogenerated from + overload
	println(c) // "{3, 5}"
}
```

Operator overloading is possible for the following binary operators: `+, -, *, /, %, <, ==`.

## Implicitly generated overloads

- `==` is automatically generated by the compiler, but can be overridden.

- `!=`, `>`, `<=` and `>=` are automatically generated when `==` and `<` are defined.
  They cannot be explicitly overridden.
- Assignment operators (`*=`, `+=`, `/=`, etc) are automatically generated when the corresponding
  operators are defined and the operands are of the same type.
  They cannot be explicitly overridden.

## Restriction

To improve safety and maintainability, operator overloading is limited.

### Type restrictions

- When overriding `<` and `==`, the return type must be strictly `bool`.
- Both arguments must have the same type (just like with all operators in V).

### Other restrictions

- Arguments cannot be changed inside overloads.
- Calling other functions inside operator functions is not allowed (**planned**).
