# Editor/IDE setup

V has plugins for many popular code editors. You can find a list of plugins in the section
[Editor plugins](../tools/editor_plugins/main.md).

Currently, the best support is provided by
[plugin](../tools/editor_plugins/jetbrains-ide.md)
for JetBrains IDE (IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand and other).

The plugin can be used with the free IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or PyCharm Community Edition.
In paid versions (GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, CLion), the plugin also provides the ability to debug.
