# Getting started

You can let V automatically set up the bare-bones structure of a project for you
by using any of the following commands in a terminal:

* `v init` – adds necessary files to the current folder to make it a V project
* `v new abc` – creates a new project in the new folder `abc`, by default a "hello world" project.
* `v new abcd web` – creates a new project in the new folder `abcd`, using the web template.
